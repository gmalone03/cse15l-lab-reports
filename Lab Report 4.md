I typed git add . and then entered.
Then I typed ‘git commit - m “yay” ’ and then entered.
I copied the git command required to push to GitHub because they ended password authentication and now you have to use a token which is actually super annoying.
I entered my password when prompted but forgot that I should actually ignore the prompt and enter my token so the authentication failed
I clicked the up arrow once and then entered
I copied my token from the first part of the command I had just copied and pressed enter.

My total time on this run was 2 minutes 15 seconds.
