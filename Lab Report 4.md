# Lab Report 4
## Log into ieng6

I clicked the up arrow and then entered.

## Clone your fork of the repository from your GitHub account

I had just entered this command so I clicked the up arrow four times and then entered

## Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

I clicked the up arrow four times and then entered to compile the tester
I forgot to navigate into the lab7 file so this failed
I entered ‘cd ..’ and then clicked the up arrow twice and pressed enter
I then clicked the up arrow five or six times and then entered to run the tester

## Edit the code file to fix the failing test

I typed ‘nano ListExample.java’ and then entered.
I fixed the typo in the second while loop from the editor.
I pressed ctrl O, enter, and then ctrl x to save and exit the nano editor.

## Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed

I clicked the up arrow three times and then entered to compile the tester.
I then clicked the up arrow three times and then entered to run the tester


## Commit and push the resulting change to your GitHub account
 
I typed git add . and then entered.
Then I typed ‘git commit - m “yay” ’ and then entered.
I copied the git command required to push to GitHub because they ended password authentication and now you have to use a token which is actually super annoying.
I entered my password when prompted but forgot that I should actually ignore the prompt and enter my token so the authentication failed
I clicked the up arrow once and then entered
I copied my token from the first part of the command I had just copied and pressed enter.

My total time on this run was 2 minutes 15 seconds.
